# IT 35 - Application Development Project

This repository is part of my academic journey in studying Information Technology. It contains the source code and resources for our subject **Application Development** (IT 35), where we explore building cross-platform applications using **Ionic React** integrated with **Supabase** for backend services.

## 📱 Project Overview

The project showcases the use of modern web and mobile development tools to build a full-stack application. It serves as a hands-on exercise to implement what we've learned in class, covering:

- Frontend development using **Ionic React**
- Backend-as-a-Service with **Supabase**
- Real-time features, authentication, and database integration

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Ionic React** – for building cross-platform mobile and web apps
- **Supabase** – as the backend (authentication, database, and storage)
- **Vite** – for fast development and hot module replacement

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JustJhong609/it-35.git
   cd it-35
2. Install dependencies:
   ```npm install
3. Start the development server:
   ```npm run dev / ionic serve


Make sure you have your own Supabase project and environment variables set up to connect the frontend to the backend.
